{"name":"AsimovCraft","tagline":"Because Robots.","body":"# AsimovCraft\r\n\r\n## What is AsimovCraft?\r\nAsimovCraft is a Minecraft mod that provides in-game robots. The robots are programmable using Python.\r\n\r\n## Where can I download it?\r\nAsimovCraft is still in development, and is not yet ready for widespread usage. However, if you'd like to play around with it, you can clone this repository and run a `gradle build`.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nCurrently, you can create a robot using the command `/rc set <hash>`, where `<hash>` is the ID of a Python script uploaded to http://haste.shabren.com. For example, `/rc set gexucuboru` will load a simple script that makes the robot move in circles.\r\n\r\n### Fuel\r\nRobots require fuel to operate. Different fuels allow the robot to operate at different speeds. The fuel types, consumption, and speed are:\r\n\r\nFuel | Actions per item | Actions per second\r\n-----|-----------------:|-----:\r\nNetherrack | 4 | 1\r\nCoal | 8 | 2\r\nLava | 50 | 2\r\nBlaze Powder | 16 | 3\r\nBlaze Rod | 32 | 3\r\nNether Star | âˆž | 4\r\n\r\n## Robot API\r\nThe api is a work in progress, but the currently available functions are:\r\n\r\n|Function | Parameters | Return Type | Description|\r\n|---------|------------|-------------|------------|\r\n|`general.sleep()`| N/A | N/A | Sleep for one cycle.|\r\n|`general.getOwner()` | N/A | `String` | Get the name of the user who created the robot.|\r\n|`general.getName()` | N/A | `String` | Returns the name of the robot if set, otherwise returns the unique id.|\r\n|`general.setName( String name )` | `name` - the desired robot name | N/A | Sets the name of the robot.|\r\n|`movement.move( Direction dir )` | `dir` - the desired direction (see `Direction`) | `Boolean` | Moves the robot one block in the specified direction. Returns true if the movement succeeded, otherwise false.|\r\n|`movement.turn( Direction dir )` | `dir` - the desired direction | `Boolean` | Turns the robot in the specified direction. Returns true if the turn succeeded, otherwise false.|\r\n\r\n\r\n|Direction|\r\n|---------|\r\n|`RobotAPI.Direction.FORWARD`|\r\n|`RobotAPI.Direction.BACKWARD`|\r\n|`RobotAPI.Direction.LEFT`|\r\n|`RobotAPI.Direction.RIGHT`|\r\n|`RobotAPI.Direction.UP`|\r\n|`RobotAPI.Direction.DOWN`|\r\n\r\n## Security Warning\r\nWhile AsimovCraft attempts to sandbox user code, there is no guarantee that a skilled hacker can't break out of it. Therefore, it is recommended that you only give trusted users the ability to run code.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nAsimovCraft is available under the terms of the zlib license.
